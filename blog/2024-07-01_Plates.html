    <h1>Niche Number Plates</h1>
    <h3>2024-07-01</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="blog_body">
    <p>I never really took note of vehicle number plates until I started driving and I started at an interesting time, just as the local government ran out of their old pattern going from 000-000 to 999-999, with a new pattern starting CA-00-AA, next would be AB, AC, etc up to ZZ, then 01-AA, my first car was issued CA-25-EV, my second car was CF-07-KR but have changed to a personalised plate SUBUWU. People that I've talked to find the large number of personalised number plates interesting, highlights I've personally seen are 3-14R8 (Pirate), OISEAU, and 404FUEL on an electric car.</p>
    <p>Here I have a niche of a niche, with people replacing numbers and letters to make personalised plates I wondered if one could have a 'hidden' personalisation, one that looks like a normal issued plate but forms a word. I quickly discovered that all plates from CA-00-AA to CZ-99-ZZ are unsurprisingly already reserved, this only pivioted my idea to just seeing what was possible.</p>
    <p>First step was to get a list of all 6 letter words begining with C, easily done with a quick search thanks to scrabble and crossword solvers, which gave me 1756 words. Next I split out the two middle letters and converted them to numbers as per the chart I came up with based off typical '1337 speak'</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A to 4</li>
      <li>B to 8</li>
      <li>E to 3</li>
      <li>G to 6</li>
      <li>H to 4</li>
      <li>I to 1</li>
      <li>J to 1</li>
      <li>L to 1</li>
      <li>O to 0</li>
      <li>S to 5</li>
      <li>T to 7</li>
      <li>Z to 2</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thankfully the first word in my dictionary works, Caaing, a Scots word for a Pilot Whale. Using the conversion we get CA-41-NG, I run this conversion for all 1756 words converting any non-matching letter to number conversions into nothing and filter out any results that are shorter than 6 characters long. This comes out to 519 converted words, lots like Caaing aren't very interesting, unless of course you're a Scotish marine biologist who wants a remote Australian personalised number plate disguised as a standard issue plate. So with that I'll give you a send off with my personal picks and a link to the full list.</p>

    <p>Sorry after going through again I couldn't stay away and bring it back to why I delved into making the list, as of writing the newest plate I have seen started with CF-71 which is getting close to the first CG plates and means 110 of the 519 words in my list are out in the wild.
